## âœ¨ Code-base structure

The project is coded using a simple and intuitive structure presented bellow:

```bash

> The bootstrap flow

- Django bootstrapper `manage.py` uses `core/settings.py` as the main configuration file
- `core/settings.py` loads the app magic from `.env` file
- Redirect the guest users to Login page
- Unlock the pages served by *app* node for authenticated users

<br />

## âœ¨ Recompile CSS

To recompile SCSS files, follow this setup:

<br />

**Step #1** - Install tools

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12.x or higher
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - globally 
    - `npm install -g gulp-cli`
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (optional) 

<br />

**Step #2** - Change the working directory to `assets` folder

```bash
$ cd apps/static/assets
```

<br />

**Step #3** - Install modules (this will create a classic `node_modules` directory)

```bash
$ npm install
// OR
$ yarn
```

<br />

**Step #4** - Edit & Recompile SCSS files 

```bash
$ gulp scss
```

The generated file is saved in `static/assets/css` directory.

<br /> 

## âœ¨ Deployment

The app is provided with a basic configuration to be executed in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), and [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/).

### [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)
---

Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.

> Install using pip

```bash
$ pip install gunicorn
```
> Start the app using gunicorn binary

```bash
$ gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:8001 core.wsgi:application
Serving on http://localhost:8001
```

Visit `http://localhost:8001` in your browser. The app should be up & running.


<br />

### [Waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/)
---

Waitress (Gunicorn equivalent for Windows) is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptable performance. It has no dependencies except ones that live in the Python standard library.

> Install using pip

```bash
$ pip install waitress
```
> Start the app using [waitress-serve](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/stable/runner.html)

```bash
$ waitress-serve --port=8001 core.wsgi:application
Serving on http://localhost:8001
```

Visit `http://localhost:8001` in your browser. The app should be up & running.

## âœ¨ [Soft UI Design System](https://appseed.us/ui-kit/soft-ui-design-system) - UI Kit

Most complex and innovative Design System Made by Creative Tim. Soft UI Design System is built with over 70 frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, navtabs, cards or alerts, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in colour, that you can easily modify using SASS files and classes.

You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code, because all elements are implemented. This Free Bootstrap 5 UK Kit is coming with prebuilt design blocks, so the development process is seamless, switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.
